# Aurora DMA
## Description

It is a Aurora DMA project. The data acquisition and control applications are a substantial, exciting area to be analyzed. These applications are mainly based on networks of multi-Gigabit serial links. For instance, the High-speed serial communication will be analyzed more deeply with a transaction between memories on our Alveo cards. We are interested in testing how this high-speed serial communication's behavior could be if it is used for the transaction with two external memory (DDR, HBM,‚Ä¶)

## Features

Compatible with the Alveo cards (U280 and U55C).

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

It is available a Makefile to generate an IP

    make generate_ip

It also have available to clean the project with:

    make clean
